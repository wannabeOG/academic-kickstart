I am currently a research assistant at CVIT Hyderabad, advised by Professors [C.V Jawahar][1] and [Vinay Namboodiri][2]. Broadly, I am interested in studying the responses that intelligent agents have whilst interacting with their environments. I hold the view that these interactions help the agents evolve a form of "language" which encodes their internal model of the environment, which could then be exploited to accelerate learning on any future novel tasks.  As such, this premise has led me to hold research interests in Transfer and Continual learning. 

I completed my undergraduate degree with a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My undergrad thesis (partly carried out at Shanghai Jiaotong University) was concerned with trying to analyze the extensibility of continual learning algorithms to a stricter evaluation setting and from this analysis, attempt to derive insights about the inherent nature of a particular class (regularization-based) of these algorithms. 

I spent Summer 2018 working on the problem of object detection in images at the [BCMI lab][3] under the guidance of Dr Hongtao Lu. I also interned at the Machine learning and Data Science (ML-DS) team at American Express in Summer 2019. I love to contribute to ongoing research efforts by open-sourcing the implementations of some major conference papers in an effort to reproduce their results.
